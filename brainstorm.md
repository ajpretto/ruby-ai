I want to create an ai app that is the all-encompassing AI for Residential Real Estate Investments and Flips. This app will allow users to search up any address in the United States, and receive a report on the property / vacant land. This report should contain the current home value (based on sf, bed/bath, proximity to similar homes, and years since latest kitchen remodel. It should be fairly obvious if a home is totally run down), and the value of the home if it were to be remodeled, based on newly-remodeled comps of the same qualifications as above. If the address is a vacant piece of land, then the report should show the estimated land price (based on comps of near proximity). There should be a remodel back-of-the-napkin calculator and a new development back-of-the-napkin calculator (these can be the same). I am a fan of the app frontflip, specifically the app's UI, which feels extremely smooth between the search and the property reports. The property reports on that app are high-level and we should strive for nothing less than beating them. I like how there is a functionality on that app to ask an AI questions about any given address. My app should prioritize the back-of-the-napkin model as a defining feature, and the model itself should be decently in-depth, and only be one page containing the inputs, static values, and final metrics. 

To this point, I've listed off various different core features that will be included in my app. I am going to recommend that each of the following core features that I've requested must be handled by their own subagent, each with a highly specialized .md file that they receive their entire context from:

1. Address Search feature
2. Property Report feature (comes after address search when the address is selected)
3. Current / Remodeled house price estimate and vacant land price estimate (based on comps)
4. Back-of-the-Napkin Model (break down the acquisition, remodel, or development process into a digestable, but not redundant at all model, that will provide accurate judgements on the buyers acquisition price, potential remodel price, and ending home value)
5. The AI question assistant feature for any-given-address (must contain both a list of common preset questions based on the home and local surrounding and a search bar for custom inquiries.)

This app should be stunning in its UI. I'm going to add plugins that give you broadened UI skills, but if you have any tricks up your sleeve that will boost your skills, then please be inclined to use them.

Ask me a bunch of questions so that we're on the same page. Plan this development in phases and be very careful about what features are phased when. Our code will be meticulously and constantly checked for accuracy and correctness. If you have any subagents, skills, plugins, or the like that can assist with that the please do so freely. Feel free to add any subagents you feel will help you complete these phases more efficiently and error-free.
